Many researchers are trying to build communication systems and
applications to leverage the potentials of ubiquitous mobile computers
and smartphones. The best approach to achieve this goal is
implementing the intended system and evaluating it on real devices.
However, it is always helpful to evaluate algorithms and systems with
simulators before deployments, especially when implementation and
deployment is as difficult as it is on cell phones.

The Opportunistic Connectivity Management Simulator (OCMS) is an
extensible platform that I developed to simulate the behavior of a
mobile device at a system level with respect to different
opportunistic connectivity management algorithms.
